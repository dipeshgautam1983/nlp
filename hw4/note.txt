Extract from the BROWN file all grammar rules embedded in parse
   trees. Do not consider punctuation as a nonterminal. Eliminate
   numbers attached to non-terminals such as '-1', '-2', etc. Report 
   how many distinct rules you found, what are the 10 most frequent
   rules regardless of the non-terminal on the left-hand side, and
   what is the non-terminal with the most alternate rules (i.e. the
   non-terminal that can have most diverse structures). [20 points]

Try to estimate how large the above grammar would be if you were to
   lexicalize it, i.e. to add head words to some of the rules. Work
   with your own assumptions. The important part for this problem is
   your general reasoning and not the details. [20 points]

NOTE: Only consider rules that have a non-terminal on the left hand
side.
